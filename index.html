        <h3>The stops: </h3>
        <ol>
        <li> <a href ="#SF">San Francisco, CA
        <li> Day at sea!
        <li> Santa Barbara, CA
        <li> Long Beach, CA
        <li> San Diego, CA
        <li> Ensenada, BC, MX
        <li> Day at sea! 
        <li> San Francisco, CA
        </ol>
        
        <h3 id="#SF">San Francisco, CA</h3>
        <p>San Francisco is the city where you embark and disembark the cruise ship. Don't forget to take a picture on the gangway!
        
        <h3>Days at sea</h3>
        <p> Days at sea do not stop at a city. You won't reach the next port until the day. On the last day though, the waves are pretty high and the bot is a little wobbly! The pool is very fun because it is like a wave pool! Be careful though!
        
        <h3>Santa Barbara, CA</h3>
        <p> Getting into Santa Barbra is more fun than you think! You get to ride a lifeboat to the port! The sand comes too high for the cruise ship to dock, so you get to ride a lifeboat! Pretty fun! <br>

        <p> I have been to this spot! It is the Mission of Santa Barbara.
        
        <h3>Long Beach, CA </h3>
        <p> Have fun! Visit Los Angeles or even some other fun places! </p>

        <h3>San Diego, CA</h3>
        <p> Visit the USS Midway and learn about the Battle of Midway and how USS Midway collided with another ship <em>during</em> a battle! </p>

        <h3>Ensenada, Mexico!</h3>
        <p>Walk around town and bring some money! The prices are <em>very</em> cheap here! But remember, you can't take food onto the ship.</p>
        <p> At the little shops, you can see:
        <ul>
        <li>Little Games
        <li>Trinkets
        <li> Candy or gum
        <li> Clothing
        </ul>
        And much more!
